# Atlanta Crime Rate Data Visualization

By: Emmanuel Muse

For this side project, I wanted to focus on Atlanta crime rates to better determine how crime occurs across Atlanta, and to improve the general public of Atlanta's knowledge and answer any safety concerns. By utilizing the csv file published by the Atlanta Police Department's from 2017, I was able to produce multiple styling of graphs to display the data in a digestable format. The data consisted of information about the offense, the report date, occurance time and date, and possession time and date. It also included the location, number of maximum victims, shift day, day of the weekm location type, crime type, neighborhood, and coordinates of each crime reported.
