# Atlanta Crime Rate Data Visualization

By: Emmanuel Muse

By utilizing the csv file published by the Atlanta Police Department's from 2017, I was able to produce multiple styling of graphs to display the data in a digestable format. The data consisted of information about the offense, the report date, occurance time and date, and possession time and date. It also included the location, number of maximum victims, shift day, day of the week, location type, crime type, neighborhood, and coordinates of each crime reported.
